RPT Cortex
RPT Cortex is the central intelligence engine of the Risk Pro Technology platform. Designed as a modular and extensible backend system, it powers secure and context-aware AI interactions for risk management, safety operations, and decision support applications.

This project is maintained by Risk Pro Consulting, a leader in practical AI solutions for enterprise and public safety needs.

🌐 Project Purpose
RPT Cortex is built to serve as the core orchestration layer for AI-driven services, enabling seamless communication between local tools, third-party APIs (like OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Gemini), and risk-specific applications. Whether you're building an internal safety alerting system or an external client risk assessment platform, RPT Cortex is the middleware that connects your model logic to real-world data.

🚀 Features
Model Context Protocol (MCP): Standardized communication layer for passing context, prompts, and resources to AI models.

Plugin-ready architecture: Easily integrate new tools, data sources, or external services.

API Routing & Tool Management: Manage which LLMs or services are active, and switch between APIs dynamically.

Context Injection System: Injects relevant domain knowledge, logs, or history into each AI query session.

Local-first Design: Supports local LLMs and deployments for secure, private enterprise environments.

🧠 Use Case Examples
Safety Alert Intelligence: Parse, analyze, and respond to safety alerts in real time.

Risk Report Automation: Generate documentation and summaries from incident data.

AI Chat Orchestration: Route prompts to the most effective model based on context or cost constraints.

📦 Project Status
This is an early-stage, proof-of-concept implementation. While the foundation is solid, we are actively working on:

Enhanced session and memory handling

Admin interface for managing plugins and settings

Model performance analytics

Improved testing and error logging

🛠️ Tech Stack
Node.js / Express (server-side)

YAML / JSON config-based routing

LLM API integrations (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, etc.)

Custom middleware for risk & safety workflows
